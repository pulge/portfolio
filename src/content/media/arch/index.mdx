title: 'Installing and Setting Up Arch'
description: "This is collection of photos I had while installing and setting up Arch Linux with Plasma 6. I just followed a tutorial online and took shots of the process. I also customized the desktop environment to my liking after installation."
remarks: "The installation process was not the gruesome experience, it's handling the ricing or customization that took most of my time because I would NEVER be satisfied. I always customized that I often DESTROY my dotfiles and start over from installation, I even bugged out my Grub. If I were to count with my fingers how many times I reinstalled Arch Linux, I would need my TOES. I eventually stopped ricing and settled with a forked Hyprland config. Also, I use Arch... btw."
