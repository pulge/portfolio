title: 'Blender Nightmare'
description: "This is collection of frames of environment, and storyboard from a scrapped Blender short film project. The project was abandoned due to time constraints, but I wanted to share some of the work I did on it. I learned some basic caricature, basic modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering techniques while working on this project. Disclaimer that I don't own all the assets used in this project."
