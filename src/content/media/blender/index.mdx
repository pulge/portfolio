title: 'Blender Nightmare'
description: "This is collection of frames of environment, and storyboard from a scrapped Blender short film project for multimedia. The project was abandoned due to time constraints, and I want to share some of the work I did on it. Disclaimer that I don't own all the assets used in this project."
remarks: "I learned some basic caricature, basic modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering techniques while working on this project. I needed to learn them in a SHORT SPAN OF TIME, that felt like a TWO SEMESTER courses compacted into ONE, even lesser because it's only a month, that's why I call it a NIGHTMARE. I did enjoy learning it at some points but would only do it again if I'm really struggling, and at gunpoint."
